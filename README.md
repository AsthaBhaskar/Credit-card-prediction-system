This is an Automatic Credit Card Approval Prediction System. The machine learning models used and compared here are Random Forest,Decision Tree and Logistic Regression.

## Problem Statement:
Many financial institutions, including national and commercial banks, base their judgment on several factors relating to individuals, including creditworthiness, loan and payback history, income norm, basic information, living standards, salaries, yearly and monthly returns, and their current source of income.
To avoid any potential risk associated with the unethical customer, adequate analysis is necessary as we observe a massive expansion in this industry. 
Banks must include accurate verification when issuing credit cards to applicants and manually reviewing each application is prominently a tiresome task that is also prone to human error.
There is a need to fully automate the process in order to speed up the acceptance decision by banks as we are seeing a rise in the significant growth margin of the credit business of the financial institution due to more consumers interested in applying for credit cards.


## Methodology:
To address the problem this paper proposes machine learning models trained and tested to predict whether a credit card will be authorised or not. Techniques for data transformation are used such as: 
1)	Scaling
2)	Handling missing values by predefined methods known as mean imputation
3)	Label encoding for numeric and non-numeric data             
4)	Dividing data into test and train sets
5)	Applying classifiers 

Results are further examined using metrics like confusion matrix to investigate the accuracy of the models implemented as machine learning preprocessing techniques.To evaluate applications, all this data is examined. This thorough examination and analysis can spare the institution from suffering several technical and non-technical losses. This project aims to create a model that can determine whether a financial institution can grant a consumer a credit card.
In this study, a model for predicting whether a financial institution will approve or deny an application for a credit card is put forth and these models can assist a company in accurately determining whether to approve or reject a card application to prevent fraud that could cost financial companies money. 


## Conclusion:
Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree are the classifiers used in this study. It is clear that the Random Forest classifier competes fiercely with Decision Tree in terms of both F1 Score and Accuracy  value, but it falls short of  Decision Tree's score and settles for second place. The analysis's final finding is that the Random Forest classifier, which has an Accuracy value of 91.70% and an F1 Score of 2.940, is the most effective model for predicting credit card approvals.
